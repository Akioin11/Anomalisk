# Documetation
## The Problem
Determine what constitutes an anomaly in your dataset. An anomaly is typically a data point that deviates significantly from the expected pattern or behavior.

## Data Collection
Gather a dataset containing both normal and anomalous data points. Ensure that your dataset is representative of the real-world scenarios you want your model to detect anomalies in.

## Data formatting
Extract relevant features from your dataset that can help the model distinguish between normal and anomalous data points. This step may require domain knowledge and experimentation.

## ML Algorithm selection
Choose an appropriate machine learning model for anomaly detection. We will use "Isolation Forest".

`clf = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)`
`clf.fit(X_train)`
`y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)`

## Training
Isolation Forest model training to the given Dataset.

## Deployment
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it into a production environment where it can automatically detect anomalies in new data.



# Conclusion
1. Understanding Anomalies: Anomalies are data points that significantly differ from expected patterns or behaviors.

2. Approach:

Define Normal Behavior: Identify typical ranges, trends, or patterns in the data.
Choose Detection Technique: Select suitable methods like statistical analysis, machine learning, or rule-based systems.
Preprocess Data: Clean, normalize, and transform data for analysis.
Apply Detection Algorithm: Utilize chosen techniques to identify anomalies.
Evaluate Performance: Assess the accuracy of anomaly detection using appropriate metrics.
3. Interpretation and Validation:

Investigate detected anomalies to understand causes and implications.
Validate anomalies to ensure they're genuine and not due to errors.
4. Continuous Improvement:

Anomaly detection is iterative; refine techniques based on feedback and validation.
Benefits:

Early identification of unusual data points.
Enhances decision-making and risk management.
Improves data quality and integrity.
Conclusion:
Anomaly detection helps in identifying and addressing unexpected patterns in data, leading to more informed decision-making and better outcomes.
